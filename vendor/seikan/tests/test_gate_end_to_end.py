"""Closed-loop reporting: synthetic data → ``run_backtest`` → ``evaluate_gate``.

The gate unit tests grade hand-built summaries; these tests certify the REAL contract — the
summary the engine actually emits is graded (cell by cell) by the real checklist
end-to-end, with no hand-shaped evidence in between. The planted series are aperiodic (random
event spacing) so the circular-shift rotation null is not degenerate, and the planted edge is
strong and consistent so the canonical thresholds are clearable by construction.

There is no verdict to assert here. Every test names the CELL (or the run-level check) whose
result it is about, and the sabotage tests additionally pin that the other checks hold — a
manipulation that flips an unrelated check is a manipulation nobody has actually localized.

The ``target_mode`` stamp dispatches the rubric: conjunction runs grade per-member floors, basket
runs grade the per-cell POOLED panel instead. The basket section at
the bottom drives a planted two-member basket through the same closed loop, and the stripping
tests pin the evidence/gate seam — evidence-only blocks may vanish without moving a single check
result, gated pooled fields may not.

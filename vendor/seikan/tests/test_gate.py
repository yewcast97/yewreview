"""The per-cell checklist (``gate.evaluate_gate``) + the DSL hash discipline.

The gate is a pure function over one engine summary dict — no storage, no models, no agent. Its
contract: EVERY check evaluated and reported (no short-circuit), every DECLARED cell graded
INDEPENDENTLY, and the summary itself never filtered. The checklist under test here: three
run-level checks (``evidence_complete``, ``source_coverage``, ``search_cap``) plus five per-cell
checks (``cell_evidence``, ``outcome_coverage``, ``signal_coverage``, ``support``,
``concentration``), NO scalar verdict and no inferential exam anywhere — a cell's ``passed`` is a
completeness / support / concentration result, not a significance claim. The summary's
``target_mode`` stamp selects the rubric (conjunction: per-target floors and ceilings, weakest
target decides; basket: the pooled panel is graded as ONE evidence pool) and a missing or
garbage stamp refuses fail-closed everywhere it would have dispatched. There is no in-sample/
out-of-sample split, so end-of-data right-censoring (``open``) is structural and allowed while an
in-bounds hole (``no_outcome``/``no_benchmark``) refuses; the fail-closed decision-side contract
holds in both layers (the per-cell undefined-decision ledger and the run-level per-source
availability panel) and stays PER-TARGET in both modes; the commensurability guard, strict
numeric hygiene (NaN / ±inf / non-integral counts refuse), and the canonical-floor thresholds
apply uniformly.

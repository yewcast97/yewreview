"""The adversarial contract, end to end through the CLI.

Threat model: the calling agent controls the thesis DSL and the CSVs, and wants a clean-looking
report for a worthless strategy. Every test here starts from a GOLDEN run whose cell passes the
checklist and applies one manipulation, asserting that the manipulation degrades the run and never
the other way. The invariant under test is deletion monotonicity — removing or corrupting input
can only ever preserve or create a FAILING check.

The exit code is not the assertion. A completed run is exit 0 whatever its cells report, so each
test names the specific check that must flip inside the emitted JSON; the tiers below are about
runs that could not produce a report at all: 2 data invalid · 3 DSL/thresholds invalid · 4
internal error (never expected here — an exit 4 from caller input is a bug in the verifier).

Every attack runs through ``seikan run --report-out``: the report is a FILE and a completed run
prints NOTHING on stdout, so the two channels are read separately — a success is read off the file
(with an empty stdout asserted alongside it, since a report leaking onto stdout would be a contract
regression this suite is well placed to catch), a refusal off the stdout envelope.

The one exception is the stamp-tampering block at the bottom: those attacks mutate a SUMMARY the
engine already emitted, which no CLI invocation can express — the CLI computes its own summary —
so they drive the same library seam the CLI itself uses (``run_backtest`` → ``evaluate_gate``)
and tamper in between.

"""End-to-end CLI tests (in-process ``main()``): the report document, every exit code, the honesty
invariant (a run whose every cell fails still writes the complete grid), lazy compute, determinism,
and the self-serve ``schema`` output.

There is ONE measuring subcommand, ``seikan run``, and it is SILENT on success: the outputs are the
four files the caller nominates by flag — including ``--entry-flags-out``, which writes the per-bar
firing mask — and stdout carries an error envelope or nothing at all. So the two helpers below
split by channel — ``_run_report`` reads the
``--report-out`` FILE back (asserting the empty stdout for free, on every report test in this
file), while ``_run`` keeps parsing stdout for the error-envelope tiers.

The exit code describes how far the RUN got, never how the evidence looked. A completed ``run`` is
exit 0 whatever its cells report — the per-cell results live in ``gate.cells`` — so every assertion
below that touches an outcome reads the JSON, never the status.

A thesis NAMES its series and never locates them, so every ``run`` invocation here carries the
``--data KEY=PATH`` pairs that answer its declared keys (``_data`` / ``_target`` build the argv
fragment). The mapping is part of the REQUEST, not of the document: it is written beside each
thesis rather than inside it, and a run whose pairs do not answer the thesis exactly is a usage
refusal before a byte of CSV is read.

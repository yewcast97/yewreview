"""Gate thresholds — the only configuration a stateless verifier has.

Four knobs (``thesis_min_trades``, ``thesis_min_n_eff``, ``thesis_max_concentration``,
``thesis_max_hypotheses``) parameterize the per-cell checklist. Environment variables (prefix
``SEIKAN_``, e.g. ``SEIKAN_THESIS_MIN_TRADES``) set the defaults; explicit CLI flags override
them per run. There is deliberately no config file and no home directory — the thresholds
actually used are snapshotted into every report, so a run is fully described by its inputs.

Four sealing rules (the policy is stamped AND bounded):

- **The canonical exam is the floor** — every knob's domain admits only its class default or
  STRICTER (``thesis_min_trades ≥ 30``, ``thesis_max_concentration ≤ 0.6``, …). A looser exam
  is rejected at construction time (CLI exit 3, ``thresholds_invalid``): a cell reported as
  ``passed`` always means at-least-canonical rigor, and the party being graded cannot bend the
  checklist it is graded by. Nothing is lost for exploration — a failing cell still carries its
  complete statistics, so every number is readable regardless of its checklist result.
- **Every numeric field is domain-bounded** — a nonsense exam (a negative sample floor, a
  concentration ceiling above 1) can never construct.
- **The ``SEIKAN_`` env namespace is owned** (``extra="forbid"``): an unknown ``SEIKAN_*``
  variable — typically a typo'd threshold var the caller believes is active — refuses the run
  instead of silently falling back to defaults.
- **The instance is FROZEN**: the floors above are constructor-time validation, so a mutable
  settings object would let a library caller loosen the exam after it had been checked. Assignment
  raises, and ``gate.evaluate_gate`` additionally reconstructs the object it is handed — the
  snapshot stamped into a report is always the exam that actually ran.

There is exactly ONE checklist, applied identically to every declared cell: no profiles, no
per-cell exemptions, nothing the caller can select into. What a passing cell asserts is
completeness, support and non-concentration — never significance — so these knobs size the
evidence a cell must carry, not the confidence anyone may claim from it.

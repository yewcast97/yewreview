"""``EventStudyResult``: the output of running a thesis through the forward-return event study.

Holds the per-observation DataFrame (one row per firing bar × horizon across every target ×
parameter combination — overlapping observations, censored ones flagged via
``is_open``/``exit_reason`` for charting) plus a summary dict. The summary carries NO pooled
headline scalar: there is no selected cell to describe, because the engine measures every declared
parameter × horizon cell and reports each one independently. What it carries instead is
``summary['cells']`` — ONE entry per DECLARED combo × horizon, non-firing combos included, each
with its own per-target statistics, censoring ledger and decision ledger — alongside the
descriptive grid rollups (``stats_table``/``by_target``/``by_param``, per-cell ``sharpe``
per-observation un-annualized, ``firing_rate`` = firings/n_bars, per-cell
``rot_p``/``t_hac``/``hac_se``/``n_eff``), the per-cell ``conditional_buckets``, the grid-level CSCV
``pbo`` block, and the run-level geometry/provenance stamps (``n_bars``, ``index_start``/
``index_end``, ``n_hypotheses_attempted``, ``sources``). Every statistic is computed over the
CLOSED observations only. The thesis is retained.

Selection is deliberately absent here as everywhere else: nothing in this result ranks or crowns a
cell, and cross-cell multiplicity is the calling agent's to price against
``summary['n_hypotheses_attempted']``.

This module also defines ``EntryListReport`` — the signal-listing counterpart to the event study;
it evaluates only the entry firing mask and lists every firing timestamp over the provided series
(see ``api.list_entries``); it carries the TWO per-bar frames the CLI ships on flags of their own —
the root-series VALUES the entry tree thresholds on (``seikan run --root-series-out``, the why) and
the 0/1 firing matrix (``--entry-flags-out``, the whether) — and it does not ride on the backtest
result.

    """Every timestamp the entry trigger fires at, ascending, per (signal combo × target).

    The signal-listing counterpart to the event study: it evaluates only the entry firing mask
    (sharing the same DSL + compiler as ``run_backtest``) and lists every True bar's timestamp —
    no forward returns, no statistics. These are raw signal firings, not observations: a last-bar
    firing is listed even though it has no next bar to fill at (observations anchor at the next
    open). The horizon axis does not affect the firing mask and is excluded from the rows.
    ``series_end`` is the last bar of the provided joined index — whether that series is up to
    date with the market is the caller's business, never checked here.

    The per-bar evidence is split in TWO frames rather than one wide matrix, because the CLI ships
    each on its own flag: ``root_series`` is what ``seikan run --root-series-out`` writes (the
    values the entry tree thresholds on, so a caller can see WHY a bar did or did not fire), while
    ``entry_flags`` is what ``seikan run --entry-flags-out`` writes (the mask itself). The flags
    earn an output of their own because a final-bar firing anchors no observation — the runner
    drops a firing it cannot fill, so it produces no trades row and no ``outcome_coverage`` count,
    and nothing in observation shape can hold it. This is the same ``vectorize.signal`` mask the
    backtest measures at, bit for bit. What no CLI output carries is ``entries`` itself: the raw
    per-(combo × target) timestamp rows below are library-only.

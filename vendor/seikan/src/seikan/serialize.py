"""JSON-safe serialization of engine results + the CLI's caller-nominated CSV writers.

``compile_thesis`` returns pandas/numpy-typed objects; these helpers coerce them into plain JSON
values for the CLI's report document. ``serialize_result`` returns the summary dict VERBATIM — the
complete parameter × horizon grid (the ``cells`` panel with one entry per DECLARED combo × horizon,
plus ``stats_table``/``by_target``/``by_param``/per-cell reliability stats and every evidence
panel) is never filtered here or anywhere downstream; the checklist renders its per-cell results in
a separate section of the report. Every output is a caller-nominated FILE — the report itself
(``--report-out``), the per-observation trades via ``write_trades_csv`` (``--trades-out``), the
per-bar root-series value matrix via ``write_root_series_csv`` (``--root-series-out``), and the
per-bar 0/1 entry-flag matrix via ``write_entry_flags_csv`` (``--entry-flags-out``); nothing
rides stdout.

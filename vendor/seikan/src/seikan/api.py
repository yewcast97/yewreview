    :class:`~seikan.dataio.DataError` with a complete per-file report on any violation) — one load
    can serve both this function and

    observation at the longest horizon refuses, as does a ``volume`` read against volume-less data
    (``params.features`` included). A barely-sufficient index is recorded as a join warning into
    ``md.report`` IN PLACE — visible to anything else sharing that ``md`` (harmless, the warning
    describes the same load) and appended again on a repeat call over the same ``md``.

    The measurement: builds the entry firing mask for every target and parameter combination,
    records an overlapping raw forward-return observation at each firing bar over every measurement
    horizon (no exit condition, no position state machine), and returns the recorded observations
    plus the summary: one independently measured entry per DECLARED parameter × horizon cell —
    non-firing combos included — with overlap-honest per-cell statistics. Nothing is selected,
    ranked, or crowned; the whole grid is measured on the whole sample. The result carries the
    ``data_report`` describing everything that was read and checked.

    the signal-listing counterpart to :func:`compile_thesis` (no backtest, no statistics, no
    horizon-runway requirement).

    Shares the event study's DSL and compiler: it consumes the same materialized ``MarketData`` (the
    caller loads once with ``load_market_data(thesis.data, files)`` — the CLI shares one load
    across both compute paths, and the evaluation memo rides it as ``md.cache``, so a backtest that
    already ran over this ``md`` leaves nothing here to rebuild) and builds the same entry firing
    mask, then
    reports every True bar's timestamp
    in ascending order — for each (swept signal param combo × target). Because it reuses
    ``vectorize.signal``, the listed firings are bit-identical to the bars the backtest measures at.
    These are raw signal firings, not observations: a last-bar firing is listed even though it has
    no next bar to fill at. The measurement ``horizon`` does not affect the firing mask, so it is
    not part of the iteration (``iter_param_assignments`` expands only the entry-tree sweeps).
    Whether the provided series is up to date is the caller's business — ``series_end`` only
    reports where the given joined index stops.

    The report also carries the per-bar evidence in two frames, and the CLI writes each one on its
    own flag. ``root_series`` holds every deduplicated root series node (each threshold operand
    except bare constants, scalarized per combo — the value frames are already in ``md.cache``
    from this function's own ``signal`` calls, or from a backtest that ran first, so no series is
    ever built twice); ``seikan run --root-series-out`` writes it, because it
    answers why a bar did or did not fire. ``entry_flags`` holds the 0/1 column per (combo ×
    target), and ``seikan run --entry-flags-out`` writes it. That the mask gets an output of its
    own is exactly the last-bar seam noted above: the runner drops a firing it cannot fill
    (``fire + off <= n_bars - 1``), so a final-bar firing produces no trades row and no
    ``outcome_coverage`` count, and nothing in observation shape can report it. Flags and
    ``timestamps`` are read off the SAME ``vectorize.signal`` mask, so they agree bit for bit —
    with each other and with the backtest. What stays library-only is the raw ``entries`` ROWS: the
    per-(combo × target) timestamp lists have no CLI output, so a caller wanting firings in list
    shape rather than as a per-bar matrix comes through here.

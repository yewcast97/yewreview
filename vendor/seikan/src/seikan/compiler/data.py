"""Load market data: strict CSV file(s) → aligned OHLCV DataFrames + external feeds for the
backtest core.

A load takes TWO inputs, because the DSL names its series without locating them: the
:class:`~seikan.dsl.schema.DataSpec` (which series, what each one MEANS to the thesis) and a
:class:`DataFiles` (which CSV each named series is, and which column of it, both supplied at
invocation). :func:`resolve_data_files` builds the second from a flat ``{key: path}`` mapping plus
an optional ``{key: column}`` one, and is the only thing that checks the two agree.

Each target (one CSV file) becomes a column; all targets are aligned on their common DatetimeIndex
(inner join) so a single vectorized backtest can run them together. External (alternative-data)
feeds are forward-filled onto the bar index — the invocation names the CSV **column** each key
reads (``--column KEY=COL``, needed only when the file holds several numeric columns), so one file
can hold several series. A shared (single-path) feed
is exposed as a ``Series`` broadcast to every target column at use, a per-target feed as a
(rows × targets) ``DataFrame``; an optional publication lag shifts a feed's timestamps before the
asof anchor so values aren't usable before their release.

Every referenced file is read through :func:`seikan.dataio.read_strict_csv` — the strict contract
for untrusted external data (ISO-8601 naive timestamps, forced-float columns, OHLC invariants; see
that module). ALL files are read and checked before anything else happens, so a single
:class:`~seikan.dataio.DataError` carries the complete per-file diagnosis; the loader never mutates
input (there is deliberately no high/low clamping — inconsistent OHLC refuses instead).

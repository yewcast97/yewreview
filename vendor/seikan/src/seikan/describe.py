"""Pure data profiling — the engine behind ``seikan describe``.

``describe`` is a pure observer of FILES the way ``run`` is of THESES: it states what the bytes
it was handed contain — levels, changes, dispersion, range position, missingness — and MEASURES
NOTHING. It runs no entry condition, opens no observation, grades no checklist and supports no
thesis; nothing here selects, ranks, forecasts, or repairs. The moment a question pairs today's
description with what FOLLOWED, it is a thesis, and theses go through ``seikan run``.

Containment, by construction:

- plain numpy/pandas only — no numba, no RNG, and NOTHING imported from ``compiler/``,
  ``analysis/`` or ``gate.py``, with ONE sanctioned read-only exception:
  :func:`seikan.compiler.runner._bar_spacing`, reused so the clock geometry is stamped in the
  run summary's exact vocabulary rather than re-derived a second way that could drift;
- admission is :func:`seikan.dataio.read_strict_csv` — the SAME strict reader ``check-data``
  runs, called identically, so the ``data_report`` this module builds is byte-equal to
  ``check-data``'s over the same files (a refused file is refused for the same reason by both,
  and gets a stub profile here rather than a guess);
- refuse-never-repair: a NaN endpoint is NEVER repaired by skipping to the previous finite
  value, a window shorter than requested is NEVER silently shortened, and every refusal is an
  explicit ``reason`` (``insufficient_bars`` / ``endpoint_missing``) or ``ratio_reason``
  (``non_positive_endpoint``) in the block it refuses — present, never omitted;
- all three change algebras are emitted with domain-nulls (``pct``/``log`` require both
  endpoints strictly positive — the positivity rule), because choosing ONE
  algebra would be the engine deciding what a series IS;
- BOUNDED OUTPUT: no per-bar array ever rides the document — its size is independent of
  ``n_bars``. Windows are BAR counts, never days; ``bar_spacing`` states the clock.
